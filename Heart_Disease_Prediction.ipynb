    ">Heart Diease are the leading cause of death globally. An estimated 17.0 million people died from heart disease\n",

    "### Q & A\n",
    ">**What is the prediction we are trying to make?**<br>\n",
    ">We want to predict whether a person is having a heart diease or not by inputing several variables.<br><br>\n",
    ">**Why is it important?  Who cares?**<br>\n",
    ">Since heart disease is the major death worldwide, it may save a lot of lives by using this prediction to inform\n",
    ">people that they may have heart disease. People who care about their health wants to know the condition of their hearts. Hospital can also use these predictions as a reference to help doctor diagnose the patient's heart situation.<br><br>\n",
    ">**What are the possible actions that could be taken as a result of this work?**<br>\n",
    ">If a person is predicted to have a heart disease, he or she can go to see a doctor for further examinations.<br><br>\n",
    ">**How do we define success?**<br>\n",
    ">We hope to have an accurancy above 80%. To achieve this, we plan to have collaboration with hospitals and use their patients' data to make our prediction more accurate. "
