    "### Problem  Introduction and Motivation\n",
    ">Car is a vital tool that makes our life more convenient. In 2022, over 92% of households in the United States have a car. Seeing the differneces between the car prices, we hope to clarify the cause of the differences in car price and build a model that helps us predict the car prices. \n",

    ">**What is the prediction we are trying to make?**<br>\n",
    ">We want to predict the car price according to the car's features.<br><br>\n",
    ">**Why is it important?  Who cares?**<br>\n",
    ">With the prediction, buyers and sellers of the car can both gain an insight of the car price. Creating more price transparency of the car. Sellers may want to see whether their price is similar to the market. Buyers may want to see if the car is over-pricing or lower-pricing, helping them to make decisions when buying cars.<br><br>\n",
    ">**What are the possible actions that could be taken as a result of this work?**<br>\n",
    ">For the sellers, they can evaluate the prices they set and make changes to the prices. For the buyers, they can compare the real price with the predicted price and help them decide whether to buy the car or not. <br><br>\n",
    ">**How do we define success?**<br>\n",
    ">We hope to build a model that the r2 in testing data is greater than 80%."

    ">The MAPE for training data is 5.700, and the MAPE for test data is 5.400. The MAPE seems to be high, but the value is smaller than the previous two model, indicating that the variables we added in our predictors has positive effect on our model. Besides, according to the R2 score of the testing data, about 56 % of price variation can be explained by our model, the performance is improving but still far from being a good model.\n",

    ">- Final model's(model 3) performance: We are not satisfied with the performance of the final model. Although the r2 of the final model is better than the previous 2 model, the percentage is still too low. We hope the r2 of the be over 80%.\n",
    ">- Proposition for next steps: Maybe adding more categorical variables in the predictors since the remaining numerical variables doesn't has a positive correlation with our target variable.\n",
    ">- What would I do differently if I could:  I would drop the missing values instead of filling it if the missing value number is too large(>10) because the more missing values we fill in, the more chance we may fill in a wrong value and thus making our prediction performance worse.\n",
    ">- Things we want to communicate to business leadership in the industry: Since both 'Engine HP' and 'Engine Cylinders' have a positive correlation with car price(MSRP), car corporates can try to calculate the cost of increasing Engine HP or Engine Cylinders of their cars, and compare to the extra revenue they can earn by increasing the price. If the extra revenue is larger than the cost, then it might be feasible strategy for the car corporate to increase Engine HP or Engine Cylinders of their car.\n",
